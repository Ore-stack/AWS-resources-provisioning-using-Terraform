# Context:

ArcticView Analytics operates data pipelines that run 24/7 to process telemetry from smart city sensors. They need a centralized monitoring solution with alerts to detect anomalies and prevent delays in pipeline processing.

## Task:
Complete the Terraform configuration to:
	•	Deploy CloudWatch metric alarms on an EC2 instance that processes the pipeline.
	•	Set alarms for:
	•	CPU Utilization > 80% for 5 minutes.
	•	Disk Read Ops > 1000 over 5 minutes.
	•	Send alarm notifications via SNS.
	•	SNS topic should be named arcticview-alerts with a dummy email subscription.

### Note:
	•	The EC2 instance is assumed to be running already.
	•	Use us-west-1a and name resources with the prefix arcticview-data-*.
